# Stock Market Predictor

A machine learning project built to analyze and forecast stock price movements by leveraging historical market data and technical indicators. It utilizes widely used Python libraries including pandas, numpy, yfinance, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to collect stock data, engineer features, train predictive models, and create visualizations that deliver actionable insights.

# Features

**Data Collection**: Automatically downloads stock data using yfinance.

**Feature Engineering**: Computes moving averages, daily returns, and other technical indicators.

**Machine Learning Models**: Uses scikit-learn models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict price trends.

**Visualization**: Generates plots of stock prices, trends, and predictions with matplotlib.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Tracks model performance using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
